# Post Mortem Report: Whats the Weather App Launch

## Overview

The Whats the Weather App was launched on April 30, 2023, with the main objective of enhancing my skills in working with a simple project involving HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and external APIs, handling errors, and creating user-friendly interfaces. This Post Mortem Report aims to analyze the issues that arose during the launch and to identify the root causes and potential solutions.

## Issue 1: API Connection Errors

One of the main issues that I experienced was difficulty connecting to the weather API.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue was unexpected traffic after launch, which exceeded the capacity of the API and caused connection errors and delays on their end.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, I immediately contacted the weather API support team and eventually received additional server capacity that helped optimize my API requests.

## Issue 2: Error Handling Issues

This issue was errors in the app's error handling, particularly in relation to displaying error messages.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue was proper placement of the error handler.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, I reviewed and updated the app's error handling mechanisms, including implementing more specific error messages and ensuring that error messages were displayed consistently throughout the app.

## Lessons Learned

Overall, the launch of the Whats the Weather App was a valuable learning experience for me, and highlighted several key areas for improvement on the front end:

- Thorough testing and load testing prior to launch is critical to ensure that the app can handle expected traffic and usage.
- User feedback and testing should be a continuous process, with regular updates and improvements based on user input.
- Clear communication and coordination with API providers is essential to ensure accurate and reliable data.

Moving forward, I will continue to iterate and improve the Whats the Weather App and to apply the lessons learned from this launch to future projects.
